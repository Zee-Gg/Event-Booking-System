DreamCraft Events is a website designed to allow users to view upcoming events and book tickets. The site features a home page, an events page that dynamically lists events, and a booking page where users can select and book tickets. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application includes a navigation system to switch between pages seamlessly. Event details are shown in dynamically generated cards, and a booking form allows users to enter and validate their ticket information. To set up the project, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and open the HTML files in a web browser. Ensure all links and paths are correct and test the functionality of the booking form.
